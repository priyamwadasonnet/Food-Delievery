**Food Delievery App**
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 Since not everyone likes the food served at railway stations, it is always a good option to order food online and make the journey even more pleasant. This application would require three modules- the restaurant/caf√©, the delivery person, and the passengers. All three would be able to log in to the application. After logging in they will be prompted for user role selection.
